                  <h2>BPO</h2>
                  <p>The cost of running a business has dramatically increased over the years. One of the methods available for businesses to cut costs is to outsource non-core business processes to firms that specialize in carrying out such operations. Many businesses, from large corporations to smaller firms, have opted for outsourcing such operations. This helps to reduce their cost overheads and increase productivity and efficiency.</p>
                  <p>Businesses outsource processes including human resources management, accounting, financial research, data management, marketing, sales, legal work, logistics, etc. to specialist Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) firms. By outsourcing these activities, businesses can concentrate on its core functions.</p>
