            <p>How are your employees currently trained? One thing you probably struggle with is finding the time to actually train them. After all, when they’re not doing their normal jobs, production is sure to suffer. A few advantages of using a learning management system to train employees in the manufacturing industry include.</p>

            <h2>Manufacturing Reality</h2>
            <p>Manufacturers are under constant pressure to reduce costs, while improving quality and productivity. However, it’s difficult to extract new or additional value from the shop floor:</p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Fragmented infrastructure – and IT systems – can lead the entire enterprise to underperform</p>
          <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i>People, public/assets, and plants can’t act in real-time to correct issues, respond to customer needs, or seize opportunities</p>
          <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i>To replace current equipment or systems introduces a significant risk to near-term productivity</p>
